
I have collected a list of URLs for each county in the states where there were 350 redfin listings.

I also did VA, as I think they will be close to, or over 350 soon.

Can you use these URLs to collect the data, then aggregate to the state level in the table you send.

I only need the individual house data on the red Redfin listings (TRUE) and not the non-redfin, green listings (false).

Can you please also collect the county level aggregates for home prices, number of listings, etc.
